pySuStaIn
============

**Su**btype and **St**age **In**ference, or SuStaIn, is an algorithm for discovery of data-driven groups or "subtypes" in chronic disorders. This repository is the Python implementation of SuStaIn, with the option to describe the subtype progression patterns using either the event-based model, the piecewise linear z-score model or the scored events model.

Thanks a lot for supporting this project.

Installation
============
## Install option 1 (for installing the pySuStaIn code in a chosen directory): clone repository, install locally

1) [Clone this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

2) Navigate to the main pySuStaIn directory (where you see setup.py, README.txt, LICENSE.txt, and all subfolders), then run:

       pip install .

    Alternatively, you can do `pip install -e .` where the `-e` flag allows you to make edits to the code without reinstalling.

Either way, it will install everything listed in `requirements.txt`, including the [awkde](https://github.com/mennthor/awkde) package (used for mixture modelling). During the installation of `awkde`, an error may appear, but then the installation should continue and be successful. Note that you need `pip` version 18.1+ for this installation to work.

## Install option 2 (for simply using pySuStaIn as a package): direct install from repository

1) Run the following command to directly install pySuStaIn:

       pip install git+https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn

Note that if you must already have numpy (1.18+) installed to do this. To create a new environment, follow the instructions in the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section below.

Troubleshooting
============
If the above install breaks, you may have some interfering packages installed. One way around this would be to create a new [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) environment that uses Python 3.7+, then activate it and repeat the installation steps above. To do this, download and install Anaconda/Miniconda, then run:

```
conda create  --name sustain_env python=3.7
conda activate sustain_env
conda install numpy
```

To create an environment named `sustain_env` and install numpy. Then, follow the installation instructions as normal.



Dependencies
============
- Python >= 3.7 
- [NumPy >= 1.18](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) for cross-validation
- [kde_ebm](https://github.com/noxtoby/kde_ebm_open) for mixture modelling (KDE and GMM included)
- [pathos](https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos) for parallelization
- [awkde](https://github.com/mennthor/awkde) for KDE mixture modelling

Testing
===============
If you want to check that the installation was successful, you can run the end-to-end tests. For this, you will need to navigate to the `tests/` subfolder (wherever pySuStaIn has been installed on your system). Then, you can use the following command to run all SuStaIn variants (this may take a bit of time!):

```
python validation.py -f
```

For a quicker run (using just `MixtureSustain`), just use:
```
python validation.py
```
instead. Testing of single classes is possible using the `-c` flag, e.g. `python validation.py -c ordinal`. To see all options, run `python validation.py --help`.


Parallelization
===============
- Added parallelized startpoints

Running different SuStaIn implementations
===============
sustainType can be set to:
  - `mixture_GMM` : SuStaIn with an event-based model progression pattern, with Gaussian mixture modelling of normal/abnormal.
  - `mixture_KDE`:  SuStaIn with an event-based model progression pattern, with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) mixture modelling of normal/abnormal.
  - `zscore`:       SuStaIn with a piecewise linear z-score model progression pattern.
  
 See `simrun.py` for examples of how to run these different implementations.

SuStaIn Tutorial
===============  
See the jupyter notebook in the notebooks folder for a tutorial on how to use SuStaIn using simulated data.
We also have a set of tutorial videos on YouTube, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CFsfFcVzEc&list=PL25fUWY3exLxYSPOnEe60kSEh0JRdVVPB).
