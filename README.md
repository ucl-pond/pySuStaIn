pySuStaIn
============

**Su**btype and **St**age **In**ference, or SuStaIn, is an algorithm for discovery of data-driven groups or "subtypes" in chronic disorders. This repository is the Python implementation of SuStaIn, with the option to describe the subtype progression patterns using either the event-based model or the piecewise linear z-score model.

Installation
============
## Install option 1: direct install from repository
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ucl-pond/pySuStaIn
```

## Install option 2: clone repository, install locally (deprecated)
In main pySuStaIn directory (where you see setup.py, README.txt, LICENSE.txt and all subfolders), run:

```
pip install  .
```

This will install everything listed in `requirements.txt`, including the [awkde](https://github.com/mennthor/awkde) package (used for mixture modelling). During the installation of `awkde`, an error may appear, but then the installation should continue and be successful. Note that you need `pip` version 18.1+ for this installation to work.

Troubleshooting
============
If the above install breaks, you may have some interfering packages installed. One way around this would be to create a new [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) environment that uses Python 3.7, then activate it and repeat the installation steps above. To do this, download and install Anaconda, then run:

```
conda create  --name sustain_env python=3.7
conda activate sustain_env
```

To create an environment named `sustain_env`.

Parallelisation
===============
- Added parallelized startpoints

Running different SuStaIn implementations
===============
sustainType can be set to:
  - `mixture_GMM` : SuStaIn with an event-based model progression pattern, with Gaussian mixture modelling of normal/abnormal.
  - `mixture_KDE`:  SuStaIn with an event-based model progression pattern, with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) mixture modelling of normal/abnormal.
  - `zscore`:       SuStaIn with a piecewise linear z-score model progression pattern.
  
 See `simrun.py` for examples of how to run these different implementations.

SuStaIn Tutorial
===============  
See the jupyter notebook in the notebooks folder for a tutorial on how to use SuStaIn using simulated data.

Funding
================
This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreements 666992. Application of SuStaIn to multiple sclerosis was supported by the International Progressive MS Alliance (IPMSA, award reference number PA-1603-08175).
